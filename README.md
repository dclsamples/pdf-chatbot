This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
This bot works off of PDFs that you upload. The screenshot below uses bitcoin.pdf.  
Upload your files and ask away!

Your .env file needs these values, so get a Pincone and OpenAI account to use:

```
PINECONE_API_KEY=""
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=""
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=""
OPENAI_API_KEY=""
```

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
